## Resource dump
Haven't been able to really work on this at all since holiday :(

Performance reviews at work have been going on so I haven't really been free at all.

On top of that we also still have to wrap up Q1 planning which is taking forever... I really need to research more on observability/monitoring for upcoming projects. I have an idea for what we're doing but I want to see what others are doing in industry to see areas for how we can improve before we start working and laying down the foundation for some of the stuff we have for Q1.

In the meantime I'm going to dump some links I was looking at along with a ChatGPT response for who are some notable people in SRE industry. Will look into some books/tech talks that they may have had.
